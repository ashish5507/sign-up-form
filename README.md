It is a simple sign up form for an imaginary odin library
I have used different concepts for example to create the sidebar with the ODIN logo and the image, I used z-index and position attributes
for the signup form itself, used form element and its other elements in HTML
styles via CSS

**NOTE that no javascript been used here
Also I have used the valid and invalid psudo classes in the input boxes
the password mustcontain characters between 4 to 10 letters (Have't specified in the UI itself)
